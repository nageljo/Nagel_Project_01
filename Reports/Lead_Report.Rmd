```{r}
lead <- read_csv("../DataRaw/lead-iq-01.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
```

```{r}
(
  ggplot(data = lead, aes(x = Smelter, y = IQ))
  + geom_boxplot()
  + labs(title = "Figure 1")
  + theme_classic()
)
```

```{r}
(
  lead
  %>% summarise(
    .by = Smelter,
    `Mean IQ` = mean(IQ) %>% round(2),
    `SD IQ` = sd(IQ) %>% round(2)
  )
) -> summaries

knitr::kable(summaries, format = "pipe", padding = 2, caption = "Table 1: Means and SDs")
```



Looking at *Figure 1* and *Table 1* above, it appears that those in the Far group have, on average, a higher IQ $(mean \pm SD = `r summaries[[2]][1]` \pm `r summaries[[3]][1]`)$ than those in the Near group $(mean \pm SD = `r summaries[[2]][2]` \pm `r summaries[[3]][2]`)$.
